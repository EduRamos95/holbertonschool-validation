- credits: Schambig
## Learning Objectives
This project aims at showing use cases where a DevOps mindset is bringing value to a software project by automating it, which decreases the amount of manual work and increases the development speed. It focuses on why automation is useful and helps speeding a development lifecycle.
After this project, you should be able to:
* Understand the value of automating tedious tasks
* Define a development lifecycle
* Automate shell-like tasks with Make, and/or shell script
* Be aware of tools dependencies and the value of reproducing environment
* Build static HTML website from Markdown code using Go-Hugo
## Prerequisites
#### Concepts
* Shell terminal basics, using command lines:
  * Navigating in a Unix file-system
  * Understanding how stdin/stdout redirection and piping
  * Showing and searching the content of a text files
  * Defining and using Environment Variables
  * Adding command lines to your terminal using the `apt-get` package manager and/or with the `PATH` variable
  * Writing and executing a shell script
* Git with the command line (and also a graphical interface):
  * Retrieving or creating a repository
  * Manipulating changes locally with Git's 3 steps process (`workspace`, `staging`, `history`)
  * Distributing changes history with remotes repositories
* Make/Makefile usage:
  * Executing tasks through make targets
  * Default target and `PHONY` target
  * Makefile's variables and macro syntax
#### Tooling
This project needs the following tools / services:
* An HTML5-compliant web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Edge, etc.)
* A free account on `GitHub`, referenced as `<GitHub Handle>`
* A shell terminal with `bash`, `zsh` or `ksh`, including the standard Unix toolset (`ls`, `cd`, etc.) with:
  * GNU Make in version 3.81+
  * Git (command line) in version 2+
  * `Go Hugo` v0.80+
* The student needs to be able to spawn up a clean Ubuntu 18.04 system. Therefore `Docker` is recommended with NO prior knowledge.
* A text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Editor) of your convenience (Visual Code, Notepad++, Vim, Emacs, IntelliJ, etc.)
